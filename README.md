# SpellChecker
A spell checker program made using the trie data structure in C. 
Name the text file whose spellings you want to check as 'input.txt'
The output file generated (output.txt) will give you the line by line errors in the input line.
Work in progress: (completed on 5/17/2019)
  - Auto-suggesting words with the corrections in ouput.txt. (can be executed by seeing which permutation of the wrong word might be in
    the dictionary. [Not all permutations to be computed] )
