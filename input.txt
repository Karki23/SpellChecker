My name is Jay Hammond. I am a firefighter.I live in 128 Pine Lane, in
Jackson, Mississippi.I have two childs. One is a girl named Clair. The other
5) is boy named Thatcher. His name after my father. I also have a wife named Jenna.
She is beutiful. She has long, dark, soft hair. We also got a dog named Buck. He is
very obedient but sometimes he barks at night and it upsets our neighbors! 
He borks very laoudly at night, hence it is very upsetting for the whole 
nieghbuorhood. Although the niebours are very freindly!
